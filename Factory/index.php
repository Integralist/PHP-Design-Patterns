     * This code uses a factory to create the Automobile object. There are two * possible benefits to building your code this way, the first is that if * you need to change, rename, or replace the Automobile class later on   * you can do so and you will only have to modify the code in the factory, * instead of every place in your project that uses the Automobile class. * The second possible benefit is that if creating the object is a        * complicated job you can do all of the work in the factory, instead of  * repeating it every time you want to create a new instance.
     * 
     * Using the factory pattern isnâ€™t always necessary (or wise). The example * code used here is so simple that a factory would simply be adding      * unneeded complexity. However if you are making a fairly large or       * complex project you may save yourself a lot of trouble down the road by * using factories.
